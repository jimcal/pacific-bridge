# Pacific Bridge

Signals and field notes bridging U.S. startups and Taiwanese public companies.

This repository supports a short, executive-level talk and a simple, scrollable website.
It is **not** a fund, not investment advice, and not a product.

## What this is
- A 15-minute narrative on the current U.S. startup / VC landscape
- A practical framing for corporate participation:
  - technology radar
  - second growth curve
  - partnership and M&A options

## What this is not
- Not a pitch deck
- Not venture marketing
- Not trend chasing

## Structure
- `/client` — frontend / presentation site
- `/server` — backend (if applicable)
- `/shared` — shared types/utilities
- `/notes` — speaker notes and references (to be added)

## Status
Work in progress. Content will evolve with discussion and audience feedback.
